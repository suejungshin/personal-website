    <p>
    My name is Suejung (pronounced soo JUHng) and I am a full-stack developer with background in Javascript, React.js, Node.js / Express, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

    My background before becoming a software engineer was in environmental regulatory compliance/consulting so I am intimately familiar with the process of first understanding constraints and user needs, then developing systems that meet them while hitting strict regulatory deadlines.
